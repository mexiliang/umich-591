Motivation
Marriage is the foundation of family, as families are the foundation of a stable society. A healthy marriage could lead to higher life satisfaction, better work relationships, and higher birth rate. However, in recent years, with the rapid development and modernization of the Chinese economy, the country’s marriage rate has been declining and divorce rate has been rising. The news often reports younger generations are less willing to get into commitment and marriages because . 

Despite there have been many successful explanations for declining marriage rate and increasing divorce rate in psychological and sociological perspectives, we are interested in finding ties with a pure data-driven approach between the marriage/divorce rate and underlying social factors, with the vast collection of data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. We hope a better understanding of the relationship between marriage/divorce rates and social factors can provide some meaningful insights for the general public, social scientists or anyone who’s interested. 



Goal
We collected registered marriages and divorces data for all provinces in China as target variables and various data from other sections of the data source as explanatory variables, including education, gross regional product, disposable income, employment, birth rate, death rate, natural growth rate, direct economic loss by natural disasters, popularization of mobile phones, possession of civil vehicles, registered unemployment rate in urban areas, number of domestic patent applications, to explore correlation between each explanatory variable and target variables. 

Our primary goal is to find the explanatory variables that are highly correlated with the marriage rate and divorce rate across the country.
